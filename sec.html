        One of the primary challenges of designing for mobile devices is that screen real estate is often in limited supply. <br>
        Through the advocacy of Luke W and others, we’ve drawn comfort from the idea that this constraint ends up benefiting<br>
        users and designers alike, from obvious advantages like portability and reach, to influencing our content strategy <br>
        decisions through focus and restraint. But that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t take advantage of every last pixel of that<br>
        screen we can snag!<br>
        As anyone who has designed a website for use on a smartphone can attest, there’s an awful lot of space on mobile screens<br>
        dedicated to browser functions that would be better off toggled out of view. Unfortunately, the visibility of some of these<br>
        elements is beyond our control, such as the buttons fixed to the bottom of the viewport in iOS’s Safari and the WebOS <br>
        browser. However, in many devices, the address bar at the top can be manually hidden, and its absence frees up enough <br>
        pixel room for a large, impactful heading, a critical piece of navigation, or even just a little more white space to <br>
        air things out.<br>
        So, as my humble contribution to this most festive of web publications, today I’ll dig into the approach I used to hide<br>
        the address bar in a browser-agnostic fashion for sites like BostonGlobe.com, and the jQuery Mobile framework.<br>
        Surveying the land<br>
        First, let’s assess the chromes of some popular, current mobile browsers. For example purposes, the following <br>
        screen-captures feature the homepage of the Boston Globe site, without any address-bar-hiding logic in place.<br>
        Note: these captures are just mockups – actual experience on these platforms may vary.<br>
